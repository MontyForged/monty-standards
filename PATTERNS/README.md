## Using Patterns

Patterns are proven approaches tested in real projects. Each pattern includes:

- **Concept** - Why this pattern exists
- **Implementation** - How to implement it
- **Examples** - Real-world usage
- **Query examples** - How to use the pattern

## Adding New Patterns

When a project (like clawdit) proves out a pattern:

1. Document the pattern in this directory
2. Include real examples from the project
3. Mark with "Tested in" reference
4. Update this README
